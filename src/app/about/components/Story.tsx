                <p className=' text-[18px] font-[400] pt-4 text-justify'> The Daily Scope was born from a simple observation: the most compelling stories often come from voices that haven't been traditionally amplified. Founded in 2023, we set out to create a space where artistic expression meets thoughtful analysis.</p>
                <p className=' text-[18px] font-[400] pt-4 text-justify'>
                    What started as a small collective of writers and creatives has grown into a vibrant community of storytellers, visual artists, critics, and cultural enthusiasts. Our platform has become a trusted source for discovering emerging talent while providing established voices with a space for experimentation and dialogue.</p>
                <p className=' text-[18px] font-[400] pt-4 text-justify'>Today, we continue to evolve, always staying true to our core belief that culture is not staticâ€”it's a living, breathing conversation that we all participate in, one story at a time</p>
